            Could not autodetect a local of the Virtualbox Guest Additions iso file.
            Please configure a local path to the iso using `config.vbguest.iso_path` 
            in your Vagrantfile or the `--iso` command line option.
            If you think this is a bug and vbguest could have guessed the iso_path,
            please file a bug: https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest/issues

            However, the no_remote option was set and thus I will not download it from
