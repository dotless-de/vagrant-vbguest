          Got different reports about installed GuestAdditions version:
          Virtualbox on your host claims:   %{driver}
          VBoxService inside the vm claims: %{service}
          Going on, assuming VBoxService is correct...

          autodetect_iso_path: |-
            Could not autodetect a local of the Virtualbox Guest Additions iso file.
            Please configure a local path to the iso using `config.vbguest.iso_path` 
            in your Vagrantfile or the `--iso` command line option.
            If you think this is a bug and vbguest could have guessed the iso_path,
            please file a bug: https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest/issues

            Could not locate a local Virtualbox Guest Additions iso file.
            However, the no_remote option was set and thus I will downlownload it from 
            %{from}
            Please configure a local path to the iso using `config.vbguest.iso_path` 
            in your Vagrantfile or the `--iso` command line option.
