## 0.7.0

  - When looking for a GuestAdditions iso file in media manager
    allow version number in filename. [GH-48], [GH-49] /
    (thanks @neerolyte)
  - Support multiple locations to be searched while "guessing"
    GuestAdditions iso file
  - On Linux guests also search "$HOME/.VirtualBox" for
    GuestAdditions iso file. [GH-48]
  - Add support for redhat-based distributions (Scientific Linux and
    presumably CentOS) [GH-47], [GH-46] / (thanks @neerolyte)
  - Fix an issue with VirtualBox GuestAdditions 4.2.8 [GH-44] /
    (thanks @jimmycuadra)
  - Reworked bunch of internals, particularly how vagrants's
    environemnt is passed arround
  - Intodruce a vagrant 1.0 compatibility layer for Installers and
    other vbguest internals

### heads-up

  - [GH-44] changes the behavior of vbguest to that effect, that it
    will no longer halt vagrant workflow if running the VirtualBox
    GuestAdditions Installer returns an error-code.
    Instead it will print a human readable waring message.
  - The environment (`env`) in custom installers is no longer the
    actions environment `Hash`, but the `Environment` instance.
    Which has some implications on how you can access e.g. the `ui`:
    instead of `env[:ui]` use `env.ui`
  - To achieve compatibility to both vagrant 1.0 and 1.1, custom
    Installers, when executing shell commands on the guest system,
    should use vbguests `communicate` wrapper. e.g.:
        A call like `vm.channel.sudo 'apt-get update'` should be
        changed to `channel.sudo 'apt-get update'`
    The old `vm.channel` syntax will continue to work on vagrant 1.0.x
    but will fail on vagrant 1.1.x.
